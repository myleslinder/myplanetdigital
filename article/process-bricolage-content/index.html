<p>Our latest contribution to the web product discourse has been published! Read the full article on <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/process-bricolage-theft-mashups-and-digital-products" target="_blank">UXMag</a> and feel free to let us know what you think. Here&#39;s an excerpt to whet your appetite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agile, lean, waterfall, UCD: each of these terms represents a host of methods and manifestos that have injected significant energy into the current landscape of digital product design and development. In certain ways, however, this environment has unnecessarily polarized web professionals who subscribe to practices and tenets—which may appear at odds across doctrines and suggest their broad differences—rather than principles or benefits that are congruent between schools of thought.<br/><br/>As digital product practitioners, we often ask ourselves: “Are these approaches compatible?” A question of compatibility implies that agile, waterfall, UCD, and other approaches are somehow mutually exclusive, or worse, that we must preserve some pure version of each as we work to integrate these doctrines into our processes. In short, this question starts the discourse off in the wrong gear. Instead, what if we asked ourselves: “What can I steal?” 
<br/><br/>
Creating digital products is an interdisciplinary undertaking that requires a willingness to mix, match, and combine creative and technical skill sets in proportions that make sense for the given context. But having a designer and developer working together is not enough. Each must be willing to compromise, modify, and evolve their skill sets to gel.
<br/><br/>
I believe that equally, the ideal process should integrate a diversity of methods where they make sense, rather than relying on a dogmatic commitment to this or that school of thought—or the uncompromising integrity of entire doctrines forced to play together. In other words, adopting a philosophy of bricolage is critical to defining an effective, self-reflexive process for building digital products.<br/><br/>
This article illustrates a fluid framework for building frameworks (whoa, meta, I know). In the context of web products, I’ll examine the bricoleur’s mindset and its application to macro-process, micro-process, and team structures. Lastly, I’ll comment on introducing bricolage, change management, and the degree of self-reflexivity needed to recognize when one’s own ‘mashup’ becomes a standard. Don your berets, people.</p>
