<p>Myplanet&#39;s Fellowship program has been featured in <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/work/jobs/new-ways-to-bridge-gap-from-school-and-work/" target="_blank">Maclean&#39;s</a> magazine. Read the full article and let us know what you think!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Julie Topp, an industrial design student at OCAD University in Toronto, can’t wait to see the web application she helped design up and running in RISE Espresso shops, hopefully in the next couple of weeks. Sound of RISE will allow customers to control a SoundCloud music queue, giving them a say in what’s playing while they sip their Americanos. “We started with the question, ‘what would be the ideal experience in a coffee shop?’” she says. “The ideal is a coffee shop playing my favourite song.”<br/><br/>
In January, Topp had zero coding or web development experience, though she had done plenty of design work at school. She was looking for a way to get job experience before graduating but faced the paradox that it’s difficult to get experience without a job but difficult to get a job without experience. Then a friend told her about <a href="http://fellowship.myplanet.io/" target="_blank">Myplanet’s Fellowship program</a>. “I had no idea what I was getting into,” she says.</p>
