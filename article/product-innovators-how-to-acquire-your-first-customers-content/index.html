			<h2 id="in-the-first-part-of-this-product-innovators-installment-i-spoke-to-vidyard-s-michael-litt-about-getting-his-video-analytics-company-off-the-ground-">In the first part of this Product Innovators installment, I spoke to Vidyard&#39;s Michael Litt about getting his video analytics company off the ground.</h2>
<p>Kitchener-Waterloo is an interesting town. Buoyed initially by the success of RIM, KW is now the de-facto startup capital of Canada, boasting many of the most promising new ventures in the country.</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="http://vidyard.com/" target="_blank">Vidyard</a>, a scrappy video marketing and analytics company that emerged from the Velocity incubator at the University of Waterloo, going on to also graduate from Silicon Valley&#39;s highly-esteemed Y Combinator program.</p>
<p>I made the trek from our Toronto HQ to Kitchener-Waterloo to meet with Vidyard founder Michael Litt and catch up on his company&#39;s progress. Between discussions of surfboard GoPro mounts and in-office gokarting, Michael shared some awesome insight into what has made Vidyard so successful. And since we happened to cover the whole thing with a couple of cameras, we&#39;d like to share that insight with you!</p>
<p>In Part One of our three-part interview, Michael talks about how he was able to acquire his first customers and prove that there was demand for his product.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF_A9sHKG6M" target="_blank">Part Two</a> of the series, Michael discusses startup incubator models and applying this thinking to larger organizations.  In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxnd0aa6T24" target="_blank">Part Three</a>, Michael discusses lead generation and how Vidyard uses an iterative development model to constantly improve the product. And finally, in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BseWzaFX_AE" target="_blank">Part Four</a>, Michael explains how lean user experience design impacts product development. Thanks to Michael for sharing his insight with us!</p>
