<p>While the sexy startup community is toppling over itself in “Lean this” and “early validation that,” in the enterprise camp, countless organizations are launching multi-million dollar products with next to no consideration for whether or not people will actually use them. This omission introduces substantial risk and potential for significant waste.</p>
<p>Call it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup" target="_blank">Lean Startup</a>, early product validation, experimentation—regardless of the label, the act of validating the value and utility of your product with actual customers before hurtling full-steam into a full-blown production effort makes good business sense. </p>
<p>Because inevitably, whether you like it or not, you’re going to learn if your product will succeed. Customers will either pay for your product (or share, or refer, or whatever your product needs to grow) or they won’t. That learning can happen after you’ve poured a year’s worth of budget (and your reputation) into the product—or it can happen before.</p>
<p>By building a simplified version of a product to determine customer demand and growth potential (yes, customers will actually pay/share/refer for this), a product team can efficiently clarify what to build on a fraction of the budget typically invested in a full release, and then expand on that core to create the full monty. And don’t be fooled: this validation goes beyond usability. An incredibly useable product may be incredibly useless if no user is interested. I call these unfortunate exemplars of misdirected effort $500k digital paperweights.</p>
<p>Of course, failing fast is <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/09/why-do-research-when-you-can-fail-fast-pivot-and-act-out-other-popular-startup-cliches/" target="_blank">quickly becoming cliche</a>. There’s certainly potential to generate significant waste by starting with an idea that is horribly misguided and banging your head against the wall with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">MVP</a> after MVP all in the erroneous name of reducing waste.</p>
<p>As is typically the case—and I’ve addressed this for <a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/process-bricolage-theft-mashups-and-digital-products" target="_blank">more tactical levels of product development doctrine</a>—bridging schools of thought is critical. We believe that early product validation works best when it’s informed with effective and informative design research. Narrowing the range of options before cooking up an experiment can help you succeed quickly. In any form—even with loose qualitative techniques—exploring user needs and opportunities to inform a product vision is critical if you want to give your early product validation the best chance of… validating.</p>
<p>Before you green-light your next 12-month product development effort (or the next time an idea is pitched around the boardroom table), ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Are we solving a problem that truly exists? Is there really a need here that we can address?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If so, do we have some real numbers that demonstrate our idea actually solves that problem effectively? If not, do we at least have anecdotal evidence that customers value the solution?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then, can we be sure this thing has legs? Will it actually take off? Do we have behavioural proof that people will actually use it (not just an attitudinal statement of intent)?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, if we validate our product and launch successfully, how can we apply this same scrutiny to every future change or upgrade?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While these questions might <i>seem</i> straightforward, it&#39;s surprising how many enterprise product teams can’t actually answer them. These questions form the basis of our product development framework. They’re like rungs on a ladder, and before we dip our toes into any engagement, we establish which rung we’re on. Then, we discover, define, deploy and analyze until we’re satisfied that we have a solid footing before moving to the next rung. This approach enables teams to explore new ideas in a low-cost fashion, or validate existing ideas before significant time, energy, or budget is invested.</p>
