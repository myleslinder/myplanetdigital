In today’s digital landscape, this includes smartphones, computers, bricks-and-mortar, television, catalog, and more.</h2>
<p>Customer experience as a concept has risen in popularity among executives - especially when irate, disgruntled users turn to social media.  Having a well-planned and executed omni-channel strategy is now at the core of organizational success. What separates the good, the bad and the ugly is the retailer’s ability to exceed the ever-heightening expectations of the modern customer.</p>
<p>In order to exceed customer expectations, omni-channel retailers need to develop internal customer experience expertise, or seek an external expertise provider. It is imperative they use technology and design expertise to optimize these omni-channel experiences, thereby reducing the risk of failure and increasing the chance of customer delight. </p>
<p>In Forresters Q4 2012 <a href="http://www.forrester.com/eBusiness-%26-Channel-Strategy" target="_blank">eBusiness And Channel Strategy Professional Online Survey</a>, 56% of managers respondents said their company supports a vision for a consistent cross channel experience, but only 23% believe they can execute a consistent cross channel sales and service experience. </p>
<p>With the rise of “SuperConnected” consumers, utilizing customer experience expertise becomes even more important. These “SuperConnected” consumers shop using multiple devices, and they now represent <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Welcome+To+The+Era+Of+Agile+Commerce/fulltext/-/E-RES58593" target="_blank">36% of US adults</a>. “Superconnected” consumers demand a level of user experience that most organizations, and especially retail giants, are currently ineffectively equipped to offer.</p>
<p>The digital elements of omni-channel commerce generate massive amounts of consumer data that is increasingly valuable in shaping a retailer’s ability to interpret a customer’s path to purchase. Executives are so overrun with data and so busy pruning and reshaping it that they have no time to see the bigger picture and are unable to objectively test and learn. This is especially concerning when serving consumers in fast moving markets is an empirical science; leaders need to test each strategy and tactic to learn what works in various circumstances.</p>
<p>Digital commerce executives need to integrate customer experience expertise that can provide them the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the customer by utilizing customer journey maps, customer research, and personas to understand the context of what the customer is doing and will do.</li>
<li>Provide a data-driven customer experience-oriented approach.</li>
<li>Evolve technology ecosystems to support and drive touch points.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of opportunities within the omni-channel space to innovate and improve the customer experience, and ultimately, developing customer experience expertise is only one piece of executing on the omni-channel puzzle.</p>
