			<h2 id="when-i-look-at-communications-services-right-now-a-few-questions-come-to-mind-">When I look at communications services right now, a few questions come to mind.</h2>
<p>What’s the next big shift in telecom? What can providers do to capitalize on it? Where do third party developers and designers fit in?</p>
<p>Over the next decade, the answers to a lot of these questions will become clear. The problem is that the investment in the next phase needs to happen now. Ultimately, that task falls to telecom decision makers. When I was reading about this, I really connected with Chetan Sharma’s 2012 study. It’s called “<a href="http://www.chetansharma.com/OperatorsDilemmaFourthWave.htm" target="_blank">The Operator’s Dilemma (and Opportunity): the 4th Wave</a>,” and it’s essential reading for anyone in the comm sector.</p>
<p>Sharma articulates the revenue curves associated with Voice and SMS, the first two waves of mobile services. With each wave we get a peak in saturation and then, after a brief plateau, they start to decline. SMS overtakes Voice, Access to Data supersedes SMS, and on and on it goes…</p>
<p>Right now, the Access business is still on the upswing but it won’t be long until it peaks. So, it’s up to us to start determining the needs of users in the post-Access phase and build products they’ll value. Fortunately, we can already decipher some characteristics of that next wave.</p>
<p>First—and a bit paradoxically—it’s not really one wave. It’s actually going to be made up of several smaller ones. That means the old model of one big, monolithic service like Voice or SMS, shared by all the vendors who then compete on cost or quality, is obsolete. </p>
<p><em>Instead</em>, providers might take a stab at mobile commerce, or cloud services, or harnessing the analytic potential of their enormous user-bases. It’s up to telecom decision makers to decide which of these opportunities they’re best situated to take on.</p>
<p>These kinds of services are about creating digital lifestyle solutions. They’re user-focused, and that means from an organizational standpoint they have to be built from the outside in, not the inside out. <strong>Human-centered design is going to be at the very core of this new movement</strong>.</p>
<p>In the past, most mobile providers haven’t done well with human-centred design. They’ve been hampered by poor software and a complex end user experience. And now they have the added challenge of competing with over-the-top service providers whose cost structures aren’t influenced by huge infrastructural expenses. This trend towards a new wave of offerings doesn’t just apply to mobile operators. It applies to most types of telecom services.</p>
<p>Infrastructure cost may seem like a real liability, but strangely enough it might be the key to putting telcos in a position to facilitate innovation. That’s because the fourth wave of telecom services will reward collaboration. We can already see some companies rushing to capitalize on the development potential of cooperation. Take the <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=2949" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Foundry Initiative</a>. They’re enabling innovation by providing forums for collaboration with nimbler, external developers.</p>
<p>And that makes sense. If we try to assess the best collaborative partners for telecom giants, it’s the smaller, leaner developers. The communications operators maintain huge technical infrastructures and networks millions of mobile devices strong, but they need software solutions developed at a rate that’s currently impossible for organizations of their scale.</p>
<p>The agility of a smaller firm means it can develop, release, test, assess, and pivot at a high pace. This gives greater and more frequent chances to validate against real customers and as a result, be truly human-centred. The more quickly a developer can reiterate that cycle, the faster they can arrive at user truth. User truth leads to user delight. To me, delight means getting past simple usability and anticipating not just the needs users think they have, but ones they can’t imagine until they’re immersed in the software environment.</p>
<p>In order to craft that kind of telecom movement, we don’t just need excellent design and development. We also need a wide enough platform, with enough end users, to make these products meaningful. That’s why collaboration between big telecom and small developers is great for everyone involved. There’s almost limitless potential for large operators to help develop a wide array of human-centred, user-oriented software applications.</p>
<p>In order for that to happen, operators are going to have to open up the power of their enormous infrastructure to <em>small firms who can handle this kind of design</em>. That can take place in lab environments, or through partnerships and vendor relationships. Once operators take that step, they won’t just be improving and deepening their user-experience. They’ll be enabling a diversity of digital lifestyle options like we’ve never seen before. The only limit is the imagination of their potential partners. That’s why collaboration is going to be a critical strategy in the coming phase of telecommunications. Personally, I couldn’t be more excited to be a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>So what’s your strategy?</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re a decision maker at a telecom enterprise or you’re providing the vision for a small firm made up of designers and developers eager to burst out of the gate and design something new, the most important thing to do is make contact, share expectations, and get creating.</p>
<p>When the next wave lands, you’ll be glad you did.</p>
