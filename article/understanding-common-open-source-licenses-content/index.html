<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank">Open source</a> is a philosophy that encourages the free distribution of a software&#39;s source code. It allows for collaboration amongst developers, who can then offer the finished product to the community at large. Before beginning an open source initiative, there are a few important questions to consider: Where do you start? Are there legal implications? After open sourcing your code, how does one ensure that it remains free afterwards?</p>
<h3 id="how-to-open-source">How to Open Source</h3>
<p>The process of open sourcing is simple. Start by uploading the project to an online repository. Github is my preferred choice since it allows free online hosting of code and strong support for collaboration between multiple developers (what every open source project desires). Next, add a license file to the repository created and update a README file for referral. Drupal, for example, adds a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPL license</a> to all its contributed projects with a README file mentioning something like: “for legal information see LICENSE.txt in the same directory as this document.” That is it. All open source licenses come with a standard “no warranty” clause so there is no troubling legal issues either.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-a-license">Choosing a License</h3>
<p>Open source licenses are classified as either <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence" target="_blank">permissive</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_blank">copyleft</a>. A copyleft license, such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPL</a> is viral. It states that all modifications &amp; derivatives of the project or code must also be free &amp; licensed under GPL (or a similar copyleft license).</p>
<p><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT</a> and <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause" target="_blank">BSD</a> are examples of permissive licenses. Here, code is free to use but has no copyleft. Anyone can incorporate the code into their project without obtaining a license that ensures that further code continues to support free projects. These licenses are suitable for commercial use – anyone can sell derivatives of the original code, provided they adhere to the laws enforced by the original license. The difference is in the choice of distribution – a copyleft license requires the release of the source along with the product, whereas a GPL does not. I prefer using GPL for all my projects exactly for this reason because it allows the code to be incorporated into larger projects, with the parent source still available to the public.</p>
<h3 id="combining-licenses">Combining Licenses</h3>
<p>Incorporating code with existing licenses depends on compatibility. A project under GPL can include MIT code. The combined work will be GPL with the original bit of MIT code, still licensed under MIT. In such cases all licenses must be included. Commercial or not, a project must include copyright notice indicating which MIT libraries it uses.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-of-open-source">The Power of Open Source</h3>
<p>Open source projects are incredibly valuble not only to developers, but to users. In giving others access to the code, we&#39;re encouraging innovation that will contribute to the evolution &amp; betterment of the digital space for everyone.</p>
