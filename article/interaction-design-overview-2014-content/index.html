			<h2 id="earlier-this-year-five-of-us-myplaneteers-set-off-for-amsterdam-to-participate-in-the-annual-interaction-design-association-conference-">Earlier this year, five of us Myplaneteers set off for Amsterdam to participate in the annual interaction design association conference.</h2>
<p>This year&#39;s conference, set in the beautiful Westergasfabriek - a gas plant from the 1880&#39;s that has been converted into a truly unique conference venue, was structured around the theme of &quot;languages of interaction design.&quot; Speakers approached this topic from a myriad of angles, considering the languages that can be used by designers to describe or explore their work with others, the languages that exist intrinsically in interactions (the dialogue between the user and the product), and the languages between products in a complex product ecosystem. While we each came in with our own interests and focus, the conference gave us an opportunity to explore the significant breadth offered by interaction design and get out of our respective comfort zones a little. </p>
<p>With that in mind, we’ve compiled this short list of insights – key takeaways we gathered from the conference – that designers can take away from the state of interaction design today.</p>
<h3 id="1-designers-need-to-be-able-to-sell-their-work-as-well-as-they-can-think-about-it-">1. Designers need to be able to sell their work, as well as they can think about it.</h3>
<p>As an industry that is so heavily centered on team-based work, it was no surprise to see a robust lineup of talks focused on collaboration and communication. This included titles such as ‘Pitching Ideas’, ‘UX designer as Business Consultants’ and ‘Pair Design’. Listening to these talks with their extensive list of trade tips served as a good reminder especially for us designers to be more critically aware of how we sell our ideas to both our own internal teams and to external stakeholders. How do we push beyond being great producers of work, to being great speakers and collaborators in the work that we do? It’s an artful skill that requires practice but with a greater ROI than perhaps many would realize.</p>
<h3 id="2-usability-testing-must-be-context-aware-to-understand-communication-breakdowns-">2. Usability testing must be context-aware to understand communication breakdowns.</h3>
<p>In the opening keynote address, <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/blog/opening-keynote-by-klaus-krippendorf/" target="_blank">Klaus Krippendorf</a> discussed the dialogical-constructivist semantic model of interaction, and he pointed out that the user is in dialogue with the product, and that the context of that dialogue is of critical importance when trying to understand communication breakdowns. This talk highlighted the opportunity for us as designers to build upon our user testing practices to be more context-aware, so that we can more readily identify and remedy those communication breakdowns across digital design work.</p>
<h3 id="3-multi-modal-interactivity-will-be-the-norm-for-integrated-digital-products-our-design-techniques-must-evolve-to-support-these-approaches-">3. Multi-modal interactivity will be the norm for integrated digital products; our design techniques must evolve to support these approaches.</h3>
<p>The typical UX designer’s toolkit doesn’t lend itself particularly well to supporting the design or testing of multiple modes of interaction, and yet, it is clear from some of the talks at IXDA, that more and more emphasis will be placed on designs that flow seamlessly from one mode of interaction to another. We as designers must get more <i>creative</i> about how we deal with things like sensor interaction or voice user interfaces (VUIs) and how they connect with more traditional interfaces in order to be able to adequately design and test these integrated systems.</p>
<h3 id="4-designers-need-to-learn-the-languages-of-other-disciplines-not-just-their-own-">4. Designers need to learn the languages of other disciplines, not just their own.</h3>
<p>As designers, sometimes we are so immersed in our work that we easily forget that there is a world outside of our day-to-day tasks. We know that most creations are new combinations of existing concepts, so to evolve and improve our discipline we must learn from different fields.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ixda.org/resources/bernard-lahousse-food-interaction" target="_blank">Bernard Lahousse</a> talked about how our experience with food is influenced by the interactions with and between our senses. In our lifetime, we build our associations with food through taste, texture and colour. The same could be said about the products we use — how does our multi-sensory perception affect our experience with products, and what previous associations do people have that may influence their perception of said product?</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/93303432" target="_blank">Zak Brazenand Wyatt Starosta</a> drew some compelling parallels between nature and UX. The products that we design interact and exist within complex systems, much like our natural ecosystem. What can we learn from the evolution that can inspire <b>meaningful</b> iterations of our products and services?</p>
<p><a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/thursday/306-ux-and-the-city" target="_blank">Jonathan Rez</a> made the connection between how people navigate through a city is similar to how they navigate through a digital product. Mental maps are created in both instances so that they can draw from memory to visualize how they can navigate. And to draw from other creative disciplines, many speakers challenged the community to look at Interaction Design through the lens of Animation (Antonio De Pasquale), Graphic Design (Gillian Crampton Smith), Comics (Scott McCloud) and Industrial Design (Jason Mesut).</p>
<h3 id="5-designers-need-to-move-beyond-their-onlyness-to-become-more-empathetic-it-s-time-to-talk-about-talking-">5. Designers need to move beyond their &quot;onlyness&quot; to become more empathetic - it&#39;s time to talk about talking.</h3>
<p>Designers pride themselves on being excellent communicators, and yet we encounter many communication breakdowns because “we have a hard time talking about our perspectives and priorities.” Using gender as a starting point, <a href="http://interaction14.ixda.org/program/saturday/409-you-re-unique-just-like" target="_blank">Tash Wong</a> discusses the variety of differences in the way we use language and approach technology. She suggests that our individual perspectives or “onlyness” often prevent us from being truly empathetic because our subjective perceptions of the world colour our experiences and understanding of language. Thus, when we are presented with the realities of project confinements, miscommunication builds and collaborators are divided by divergent expectations.</p>
<p>This session highlighted the need to design our conversations to clarify the unspoken expectations early and often. It also serves as a reminder that enabling understanding and empathy amongst project collaborators, is just as critical to producing amazing user experiences as empathizing with end users.</p>
<p>While these insights are simple, they will become catalysts for us to conceptualize new strategies, processes, and practices to contribute back to the interaction design community and ensure we can offer the best work for our clients. </p>
<p><b>Check back soon to see how we’re building on these insights at Myplanet!</b></p>
