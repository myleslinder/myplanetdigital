Lassonde aims to infuse this not only within their education, but to encourage student to incorporate these principles into their everyday lives. Myplanet was the force that propelled this vision to fruition.</h2>

<h3 id="developing-the-intricate-link-between-creativity-engineering">Developing the Intricate Link Between Creativity &amp; Engineering</h3>
<p>With the growth of the <a href="http://lassonde.yorku.ca/" target="_blank">Lassonde School of Engineering</a> within the York University Community, Myplanet was excited about the opportunity to play a key role in not only designing the web presence, but also in building the brand that will represent the school for years to come. The site needed to be flexible enough to fully represent each department within the Lassonde School of Engineering, while maintaining the school&#39;s main brand. </p>
<p>Beginning with in-depth user and stakeholder research, the Myplanet team was tasked to understand the key needs of the site&#39;s primary users. Building personas for prospective students, current students, outside community members and staff/faculty, the user research team was able to develop a thorough understanding of the site’s wide breadth of key users. </p>

<h3 id="telling-the-lassonde-story">Telling the Lassonde Story</h3>
<p>The main goal of the new Lassonde website was to tell a story; to challenge the perception of engineering and education by focusing on creative thinking. Creating a community for students to connect, learn and engage across multiple disciplines and perspectives was an important part of demonstrating why Lassonde is so unique. </p>
<p>Lassonde provides visitors with an immersive experience for prospective students, faculty/staff, first time visitors and individuals from outside the community. Myplanet cultivated the narrative of Renaissance Engineering through a continuum that shed an inspirational light on the power of embracing creative thinking in a more traditional field. This story provides Lassonde with the power to influence a generation of go-getters that help shape our future.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-holistic-experience-through-compelling-content">Creating a Holistic Experience Through Compelling Content</h3>
<p>Unifying content across multiple mediums proved difficult. Using user-centered content creation and curation, the Lassonde website is an immersive experience with rich content and interactivity that promotes engagement and exploration. By focusing on real user goals, Myplanet was able to build a frictionless &quot;navigation-as-needed&quot; approach that guided users to appropriate content, without overwhelming them with options.</p>
<p>Other features of the project include responsive design with individual layouts for mobile, tablet and laptop/desktop computers, dynamic animations in the header, sticky navigation elements and customized social media integrations.</p>
<p>The content architecture used for Lassonde provided a durable, but flexible system, that easily facilitates the addition of new content, while still maintaining the structure of existing information. This fluidity is designed to expand with the evolution of the Lassonde website, as well as adapt to a plethora of screens sizes on mobile, tablet and desktop.</p>
