			<h2 id="with-only-two-weeks-left-in-this-season-s-fellowship-program-teams-are-close-to-presenting-their-final-products-">With only two weeks left in this season&#39;s Fellowship program, teams are close to presenting their final products.</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the term back in January, Fellows formed teams and chose a particular problem they wished to tackle. They conducted user research and design studios and learned about concepts like art boards &amp; key archetypes. They began learning the ins &amp; outs of Drupal and were introduced to key modules like views and panels. They prioritized backlogs and began to actually build working digital products.</p>
<p>Now almost three months later, Fellows are nearing the completion of their polished products. Here&#39;s a preview of what we&#39;ll see in action on Graduation Day.</p>
<h3 id="morning-bird-team-mytitan-">Morning Bird -Team <myTitan></h3>
<div class="image"><img src="/associated-files/article/fellow-projects-0/body_1.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>This web application is designed to help users wake up in the morning. Built with Twilio, users can set alarms online and receive an SMS alert through their mobile device. Morning Bird also incorporates a gamification component. When an alarm is set, it prompts the user to answer a simple skill-testing question either in Science, Math, or History and rewards them with badges. The alarm turns off once the question is answered correctly. Staying true to their slogan &quot;waking up is easy, staying up is hard&quot;, this app will prove useful for those of us who hit snooze for an hour before actually getting out of bed.</p>
<h3 id="shift-team-goodfellas">Shift- Team GoodFellas</h3>
<div class="image"><img src="/associated-files/article/fellow-projects-0/body_2.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>This web application is designed to help co-workers switch shifts easily with one another. By aggregating &amp; displaying everyone&#39;s shifts in one place, employees can anticipate when they can and can&#39;t ask for time off. It also avoids the hassle of having to coordinate shift changes with a lengthy game of phone tag &amp; multi-tiered approvals. The interface is a simple calendar view that arranges time blocks by colour.</p>
<h3 id="event-planner-team-martian">Event Planner- Team Martian</h3>
<div class="image"><img src="/associated-files/article/fellow-projects-0/body_3.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>This web product is designed for event planners to promote and aggregate social media content onto one page, in one view. It serves as a promotional tool, encouraging users to attend the event. During the event, it pulls feeds from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube and loads content in real-time as the event is happening. Users can refer to the stream to connect with other guests at the event. </p>
<h3 id="q-app-team-tectonic-play">Q&amp;App-Team Tectonic Play</h3>
<div class="image"><img src="/associated-files/article/fellow-projects-0/body_4.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>Ever had a question you wanted to ask a speaker at a conference but didn&#39;t get the chance? The Q&amp;App allows any attendee to post a question to a virtual board, and users can upvote the questions they&#39;d most like to see answered. This ensures that speakers are addressing the questions that are most relevant to the audience, while encouraging engagement amongst attendees.</p>
<h3 id="kairos-team-the-iterators">Kairos-Team The Iterators</h3>
<div class="image"><img src="/associated-files/article/fellow-projects-0/body_5.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>Unlike other project management tools, Kairos is designed to inform users about their individual capacity to take on more work. Geared towards freelancers, a quick glance at the dashboard tells users whether they have the capacity to take on more or less work at a given time, and shows them how overlapping projects could impact one another. Using data-visualization through Angular.js, this application displays things like project length and projected milestones. </p>
<p>Fellows will launch their finished products on the last day of the program. We&#39;ll share further info &amp; links to download these awesome apps in early April. Keep up the great work, Fellows!</p>
