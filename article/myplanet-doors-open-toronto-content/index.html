<p>The 15th annual <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=42eafa2cd4a64410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD" target="_blank">Doors Open Toronto</a> presented by Great Gulf is a city-wide celebration offering free, rare access to more than 155 architecturally, historically, culturally and socially significant buildings across Toronto.</p>
<p>This year&#39;s theme is Secrets and Spirits... exploring the Mysteries Behind the Door. Close to 80 locations feature secret spaces, stories of spirit sightings and unexplained mysteries. Look for the mysterious keyhole icon while browsing the list of participating buildings or walking tours.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="/associated-files/article/myplanet-doors-open-toronto/Bank-of-Upper-Canada.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>The Bank of Upper Canada was constructed in 1825 and is a designated National Historic Site of Canada. The building was designed in the Palladian architectural style. This two-and-a-half story Neoclassical building received this designation for the role that the bank played in the development of Upper Canada, the contribution it made to Torontoâ€™s rise as an economic centre and the design of the building. Notable heritage features of the building include neoclassical portico (designed by John G. Howard), a stone exterior that features rusticated masonry on the foundation as well as smooth-dressed stonework on the upper storeys.</p>
<p>Inside, visitors will find a mix of preserved heritage features as well as modern interior design elements. Some of the preserved heritage features include original columns, paneling and interior shutters.</p>

<p>Myplanet made the <a href="http://myplanet.io/article/myplanet-welcome-to-toronto/" target="_blank">big move to downtown Toronto</a> back in December and it was a huge step in the evolution of our company. We are  extremely proud to occupy the entire Bank of Upper Canada building and are looking forward to expanding and maintaining our historic site. We are also super excited to be featured on <a href="http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/05/the_top_10_buildings_to_see_at_doors_open_toronto_2014/" target="_blank">blogTO&#39;s Top 10 Buildings to See at Open Doors 2014!</a></p>
