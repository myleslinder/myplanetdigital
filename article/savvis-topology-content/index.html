<div class="image" style="width:70%"><img src="/associated-files/article/savvis-topology/myplanet-for-savvis.jpg" alt=""></div>

<h3 id="the-background-changing-technology-aggressive-competition">The Background: Changing Technology &amp; Aggressive Competition</h3>
<p><em>Savvis was acquired by CenturyLink in 2011.</em></p>
<p>They’re positioned at the top of their field because they have everything you’d expect from a successful company – great products, excellent customer service, competitive pricing and a helpful and effective workforce. <a href="http://www.centurylinktechnology.com/en-ca/" target="_blank">CenturyLink Technology Solutions</a> also focuses on consistent innovation to ensure they continue offering best-in-class solutions to their market.</p>
<p>Even with all of these positive characteristics, CTS still has to compete with big-name competitors like Amazon and Rackspace. And with the rise of cloud computing, they also face a seismic shift in the way their industry does business.</p>
<p>CTS wants to continue leading the way by approaching their offering differently, showing their market they have fresh, exciting technology and are going to continue being a top company in their field – now and into the future.</p>
<div class="image-full no-line"><img src="/associated-files/article/savvis-topology/savvis-side.jpg" alt=""></div>

<h3 id="the-challenges-a-multitude">The Challenges: A Multitude</h3>
<p>Traditionally, companies had to buy physical hardware to create a private data centre network. It was extremely costly and demanded a great deal of time for company specialists to build and deploy. In some cases, technicians had to physically travel to the hosting location, often very far away, to set up and configure hardware manually.</p>
<p><em>Cloud computing changed the game.</em></p>
<p>Now, servers are virtual, running on large pools of commodity hardware. But even virtual networks demand a ton of work to set up. Extensive and detailed programming is required which involves countless work hours to write and incredibly complex networks create challenges for even skilled and experienced specialists. In addition, because it’s still hard to see how all the network components work together, if there’s a problem it can take months of painstaking effort to locate and correct.</p>
<p>If CTS could introduce a simpler way of creating and managing networks, one that <strong>saved time, was less costly and made things easier for users</strong>, they’d have developed a powerful competitive differentiator, helping them stand above the rest of the field.
They wanted a solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equally useful for everyone regardless of their level of network architecture expertise.</li>
<li>Automated when desired yet offering manual control when needed.</li>
<li>Scalable in terms of size, features and levels of abstraction.</li>
<li>Visually interesting and technically robust.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was completely unknown ground – exciting (but challenging!)</p>
<p>CTS had one final request, that Myplanet have a prototype ready for VMworld, the “global conference for virtualization and cloud computing.”</p>
<p>Considering the large scope and unique requirements of the project and the fact that VMworld was only four short months away, the Myplanet team had their work cut out for them.</p>
<h3 id="the-approach-agile-team-accelerated-development">The Approach: Agile Team &amp; Accelerated Development</h3>
<p>Because the deadline was tight and there was so much to get done, Myplanet developed a very aggressive approach.</p>
<p>The 5-member team of UX, analysis and front end developers focused on rapid ideation while quickly zeroing in on concepts to improve the virtual data centre management experience.</p>
<p>After ideation, the team planned to integrate a few selected concepts into a cohesive prototype for demonstration at VMworld.</p>
<div class="image-full no-line"><img src="/associated-files/article/savvis-topology/savvis-multiple.jpg" alt=""></div>


<h3 id="the-ideation-brainstorming-a-breakthrough">The Ideation: Brainstorming a Breakthrough</h3>
<p>CTS wanted Myplanet to develop a new approach to visualizing and constructing a virtual data centre, emphasizing the topology (or arrangement) of the network.</p>
<p>The Myplanet team was going to have to create a tool that provided an overview of the connectivity of the system, showed how servers in the data centre communicated with one another and how data flowed between machines… and only had a few months to make it happen.</p>
<p>We realized there were two major challenges to get the job done.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, to visually display how a network looks and how various components actually work together.</li>
<li>Second, to develop a codebase that would convert data into the new visual display.
Once in a while a great idea really pulls it all together.</li>
</ul>
<p>During a brainstorming session, a team member mentioned a network diagram reminded him of a map of the <a href="http://cdn.londonandpartners.com/images/explorer-map/tubemap-2012-12.png" target="_blank">London tube</a> with the branches, stations and colours representing different components of a virtual network.</p>
<p>This insight helped Myplanet visualize what the CTS network topology tool could actually look like.</p>
<div class="image-full no-line"><img src="/associated-files/article/savvis-topology/savvis-top.jpg" alt=""></div>

<h3 id="the-execution-a-sprint-to-the-finish-line">The Execution: A Sprint to the Finish Line</h3>
<p>Myplanet’s initial approach was to solve the problem as quickly as possible, in the form of a web interface, however; after the first concept, the team realized the problem was too complex to solve in one iteration.</p>
<p>The team decided to operate in ‘one week sprints’. First, identifying the problem, offering a solution, developing and validating – then highlighting gaps and tightening things up week by week until there was a working prototype meeting the needs identified by both the client and the market.</p>
<p>To make sure everything was on the right track, the Myplanet team ran weekly demos, noting user feedback for later integration.</p>
<p>Over time, we developed two key assets:  A composite displaying the topology of a network and a codebase that converted data into a visualization.</p>
<p><em>It worked.</em></p>
<p>The second phase of the project focused on integrating features like dynamic sorting, filtering and search, taking the concept to the point where it would be usable as a real-world network management and construction tool.</p>
<h3 id="the-results-a-new-paradigm">The Results: A New Paradigm</h3>
<p>After months of focused effort, gallons of coffee, late nights, frustrations and breakthroughs - Myplanet met the deadline and CTS had a working prototype for presentation at VMworld.</p>
<p>The CTS Virtual Private Data Centre (VPDC) developed by Myplanet lets users define, configure and deploy a full virtual data centre. <strong>There’s no need to buy, install, configure, or manage any hardware.</strong></p>
<p>It’s capable of containing a complete set of enterprise data centre services including compute instances of varying sizes, multiple tiers of storage, a wide variety of security features, high-performance, redundant bandwidth and load balancing.</p>
<p>The VPDC offers reliable, universal access to cleared users, provides instant gratification for every step in the process and of course, privacy and security.</p>
<p>The reception of Myplanet’s work at the conference was outstanding and the value of this new approach to topology goes right to the heart of current industry challenges:</p>
<p>By enabling network administrators to easily create network topology diagrams allowing for data centre and application management, the technology showed a large improvement in customer experience and task completion times.</p>
<p>CTS were viewed as industry innovators at VMworld, exactly what they wanted – and created a unique space in their industry with a new and exciting piece of technology.</p>
<p>Myplanet’s offering has created a paradigm shift and a fresh dialogue in the marketplace - directly benefitting our client while carving out a powerful position for them in a highly competitive marketplace.</p>
