<div class="image" style="width:70%"><img src="/associated-files/article/mitel/myplanet-for-mitel.jpg" alt=""></div>

<h3 id="who-is-mitel-">Who is Mitel?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.mitel.ca">Mitel</a> is focused on providing complete business communication solutions for every customer need.</p>
<h3 id="mitel-s-project-initiatives">Mitel&#39;s Project Initiatives</h3>
<p>For a company that prides itself on providing unified communications across multiple platforms, the back-end architecture of their website was surprisingly clunky, making it difficult to update and manage content. Mitel needed to refresh their website to ensure it easily scale with their growing brand.</p>
<p><strong>When Mitel came to Myplanet to update their current website, the following goals were set:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Help new and prospective customers engage with Mitel’s past partner network who distribute Mitel products and help customers use them effectively.</li>
<li>Lower the bounce rate of current and prospective Mitel clients on the website.</li>
<li>Increase response times of the website.</li>
<li>Make the website responsive to ensure an optimal experience on any device.</li>
<li>Make the Mitel.com site adaptable to keep up with market needs and new branding/design directions.</li>
</ul>
<div class="image-full no-line"><img src="/associated-files/article/mitel/mitel-side.jpg" alt=""></div>

<h3 id="mitel-s-business-goals">Mitel&#39;s Business Goals</h3>
<p>Mitel’s overarching business goals for the website redesign are listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure Mitel is continuously regarded as a thought leader in the telecommunications space.</li>
<li>Update the site regularly with accurate, high-quality information and industry-leading editorial content.</li>
<li>Increase and drive leads to Mitel’s channel partners around the world.</li>
<li>Site refresh deployment to 105 countries and 7 languages.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-myplanet-solution">The Myplanet Solution</h3>
<p>Myplanet was approached by Mitel to implement a full redesign of Mitel’s global corporate website. Myplanet spoke with Mitel.com&#39;s customer base to uncover user truth and focused on user-centered design to ensure Mitel&#39;s needs were met.</p>
<p>Myplanet and Mitel&#39;s collaborative relationship allowed for rapid development and enabled the project to accommodate large pivots with relative ease.</p>
<p>“We went with Myplanet because we wanted to work with an Agile agency. I was very impressed with their commitment to the process. They helped educate us on a version of Agile that felt authentic to what Agile is. They truly practice it.”</p>
<div class="image-full no-line"><img src="/associated-files/article/mitel/mitel-multiple.jpg" alt=""></div>

<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>
<p>To decrease the site&#39;s bounce rate, we needed to recreate an ideal experience for first-time visitors. By testing over a dozen concepts, we were able to validate the most effective solution that generated leads to certain sections of the site by a fourfold increase.</p>
<p>“The foresight to put in a framework that allows us to easily customize the rebrand is coming into play right now. There’s a lot to do with the site still, but with the framework we now have, we can take it anywhere.”</p>
<p>Quantitative results that solved Mitel’s business problems are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>4x increase in quality leads.</li>
<li>60% increase in Mitel.com’s visitors navigating to more than 1 page.</li>
<li>50% decrease in page load times.</li>
<li>Beautiful, responsive design on any device, class or break point.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-future-of-mitel-myplanet">The Future of Mitel &amp; Myplanet</h3>
<p>The partnership between Mitel and Myplanet has only just begun. We worked together on the Mitel.com refresh to set common goals and ensure that each objective was achieved in a manner that satisfied Mitel’s vast customer base. Mitel &amp; Myplanet’s partnership will continue to evolve and grow as Mitel’s business goals change and adapt to the current marketplace demands.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The relationship we developed with Myplanet stemmed from the complexities that go along with creating a global marketing web solution. We’re fully engaged in our rebrand project with Myplanet, and we’ll continue to work with them as we go into Phase 2 of the website and beyond.”</p></blockquote>
