<p>The 15th annual <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=42eafa2cd4a64410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD" target="_blank">Doors Open Toronto</a> presented by Great Gulf is a city-wide celebration offering free, rare access to more than 155 architecturally, historically, culturally and socially significant buildings across Toronto.</p>

<p>The Bank of Upper Canada was constructed in 1825 and is a designated National Historic Site of Canada. The building was designed in the Palladian architectural style. This two-and-a-half story Neoclassical building received this designation for the role that the bank played in the development of Upper Canada, the contribution it made to Toronto’s rise as an economic centre and the design of the building. Notable heritage features of the building include neoclassical portico (designed by John G. Howard), a stone exterior that features rusticated masonry on the foundation as well as smooth-dressed stonework on the upper storeys.</p>
<p>Inside, visitors will find a mix of preserved heritage features as well as modern interior design elements. Some of the preserved heritage features include original columns, paneling and interior shutters.</p>

<p>Myplanet made the <a href="http://myplanet.io/article/myplanet-welcome-to-toronto/" target="_blank">big move to downtown Toronto</a> back in December and it was a huge step in the evolution of our company. We are  extremely proud to occupy the entire Bank of Upper Canada building and are looking forward to expanding and maintaining our historic site. We are also super excited to be featured on <a href="http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/05/the_top_10_buildings_to_see_at_doors_open_toronto_2014/" target="_blank">blogTO&#39;s Top 10 Buildings to See at Open Doors 2014!</a></p>
