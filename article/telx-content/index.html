<p><a href="http://www.telx.com/" target="_blank">Telx</a> prides itself on helping build more agile networks and businesses with 100% uptime and reduced infrastructure complexity with broader reach. </p>
<p>Telx reached out to Myplanet to better understand the feasibility of an offering called Network as a Service (NaaS). This offering would provide the ability for Telx customers and other ecosystem partners to instantaneously and seamlessly connect to the TW Telecom network. </p>
<p>At the time, the offering was in its infancy, with many unanswered questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the key users? </li>
<li>What is the demand and willingness to pay for this offering? </li>
<li>What does the ease-of-use and navigability of the application look like? </li>
</ul>
<p>Telx needed to understand these concerns in order to justify making further investment into the purchasing of hardware that would enable dynamic connectivity and provisioning,
the hiring of a consultant company to build the API that would interface with new hardware
and the hiring of user experience, design and development to build the platform that would be accessed by users.</p>
<p>Myplanet&#39;s goal was to prototype an interface that would capture the core value of the offering: dynamic network configuration and payment, so that Telx could showcase it and vet the demand with potential new customers. </p>
<div class="image-full no-line"><img src="/associated-files/article/telx/workflowprocess.jpg" alt=""></div>


<p>Leading with one of the core tenants of human-centred design of first engaging with users,  Myplanet kicked off our engagement by working with Telx to recruit a vetted pool of users across various networking organizations (including Telx). We interviewed over 30 individuals — network technicians, engineers, client service representatives, and sales people, to understand the biggest pain points and opportunities around the current state of network configuration, deployment, payments, and support. </p>
<p>Our findings were then presented over a 3 day, on-site workshop, with a goal to build consensus around next steps and a shared vision among marketing, sales, technology and product teams. Myplanet and Telx ideated through several hypotheses around the needs of users, solutions  and business &amp; marketing strategies to challenge competitors. It was also used as the starting point for understanding risks associated with dynamic interconnection, to surface discrepancies between different stakeholders on the core purpose of the offering and work towards a shared vision.</p>
<p>With this shared vision, Myplanet produced an interactive prototype of a new order flow that was intuitive for first-time users. This deliverable was built to integrate with Telx’s existing information architecture and was subsequently used to further explore and validate hypotheses around user needs and prospective business value opportunities.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The entire team at Telx was really impressed with the workshop Myplanet delivered and facilitated. It’s also impressive when you are working with a vendor that immediately gets our technologies and can gain the trust of our participants. You made me look good, and for that I am grateful.”</p></blockquote>
