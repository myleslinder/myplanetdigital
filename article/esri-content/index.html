<div class="image" style="width:70%;"><img src="/associated-files/article/esri/myplanet-for-esri.png" alt=""></div>

<p>To help <a href="esri.ca" target="_blank">Esri Canada</a> efficiently realize their vision, we focused on upfront research, defining system needs in terms of user goals, and designing and building the system in tandem throughout an Agile implementation phase. End-user interviews gave insight into the needs of users and areas for improvement, and the close collaboration between Myplanet’s technical and creative team members with Esri Canada’s stakeholders encouraged a balanced approach. </p>
<h3 id="fostering-simplicity-through-multi-layered-navigation">Fostering Simplicity Through Multi-Layered Navigation</h3>
<p>The task was to examine Esri Canada’s information architecture, interaction patterns and overall content strategy to design and build a unified digital experience for their users.</p>
<p>But how could a single website balance the needs of various users from different industries and on different devices, while supporting a deep, multi-layered navigation structure?</p>
<p>Throughout the project, we focused our efforts heavily on the main high-traffic areas of the site, sections dedicated to helping users find resources and register for training and events. Our research revealed that these areas would require the most attention to improve accessibility, navigation and overall user experience across various device classes and form factors. Prototyping and testing against our hypotheses, we developed an informed responsive design solution to enhance the general accessibility of content.</p>

<h3 id="solving-for-multiple-industry-users">Solving for Multiple Industry Users</h3>
<p>In addition, our user research quickly revealed a need to provide focused content to users who belong to different industries and use Esri Canada products in a variety of ways. </p>
<p>To satisfy this need, we implemented a <em>“Catered Content Delivery”</em> strategy across the site with emphasis on heavier traffic areas and sections where information would be shared across multiple user types. Now, the website’s filterable lists, taxonomy relationships to aggregate information, iconography and colour help orient the different user groups and provide them with the necessary tools to efficiently retrieve information. </p>
<p>At the same time, our content strategy maximizes the value of contextual content encounters. For example, healthcare professionals visiting Esri Canada’s website may access the healthcare industry hub page and explore the case studies they were looking for, as well as other resources aggregated and tagged with “healthcare.” Or, while reading through relevant GIS applications and learning how Esri solutions could benefit their industry, they could also take note of industry-specific testimonials and view upcoming training and events related to the solutions used in their industry. </p>
<div class="image-full no-line"><img src="/associated-files/article/esri/esri-2.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>Our phased Agile UX process, research, and defining system needs in terms of user goals unveiled many complexities and challenges, which we solved through prototyping and testing. The challenges we faced led us to think about the system holistically and in the end, Myplanet and Esri Canada launched a successful website. The new website has been well-received and is helping the company provide a better customer experience. </p>
