			<h2 id="myplanet-welcomes-our-largest-class-of-fellows-to-date-">Myplanet welcomes our largest class of fellows to date.</h2>
<p>So what’s a fellow, you ask? </p>
<p>Myplanet Fellows are current university or college students looking to gain real, paid work experience while they&#39;re completing their degrees. Fellows are paired with a mentor at Myplanet whose area of expertise matches that of the fellow&#39;s interest. Mentors will work alongside the fellows to ensure they&#39;re being challenged and supported in their work. </p>
<p>Typically, fellows work 7-10 hours per week for one semester on real projects and problems. At the end of the Fellowship term, many fellows are offered a co-op or full-time position at Myplanet, where they&#39;re invited to join a production team and start contributing from day one.</p>
<p>Since we welcomed our first class of Fellows in September of 2011, we have evolved the program significantly. Here are a few of the key changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth In Numbers:</strong> We&#39;ve more than doubled in numbers vs. our first Fellowship intake. Previously we welcomed 10 students, and this year we&#39;re thrilled to have 25 fellows on board. They&#39;re a great mix of developers, designers and business-minded folks. This year&#39;s fellows study at the University of Waterloo, Conestoga, the University of Toronto, Athabasca, George Brown, OCAD and Sheridan College.</li>
<li><strong>Team Development:</strong> We&#39;ve evolved the format of the program so that Fellows will now work as members of a scrum team to foster agile thinking, creativity and collaboration. Previously, fellows would work alongside a team whose area of focus met the fellow’s specific interest. For example, those with a design focus would work as an extension of the creative team. This year, fellows will work as members of a self-sufficient scrum team (with developers, designers &amp; a product owner).  By simulating our actual organizational structure they will gain a thorough understanding of how we work and be ready to jump into a scrum team once they graduate.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Directed Learning:</strong> We have developed a curriculum that is flexible and self-directed. Fellows can choose problems they wish to tackle and create their own products. They choose how they want to learn and select the tools they need. Whether they jump into a webinar, research a particular subject area, or decide that they need to attend a workshop - they shape their own learning experience. </li>
<li><strong>Simulated Learning:</strong> With this year&#39;s fellows, we&#39;ve created an enviroment that mimics Myplanet&#39;s Startup within a Startup concept. Essentially, teams work as independant startups - with the added benefit of organizational support. They choose a particular problem that they wish to tackle, create a backlog that indicates &amp; priortizes tasks neccessary to solve that problem, and hopefully will launch a successful solution at the end of the term. We&#39;ll modify project requirements along the way so that teams can learn &amp; embrace agile thinking throughout the development cycle. </li>
</ul>
<p>As our organization constantly evolves, so will our Fellowship program. We couldn&#39;t be more excited about welcoming 25 new fellows to the Myplanet family this year as we invite them to take part in our growth!</p>
