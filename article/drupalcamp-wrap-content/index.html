<p>With nearly 200 Drupal lovers in attendance, DrupalCamp Toronto was further affirmation that this community is commited to improving the functionality &amp; usability of Drupal. With keynotes from Drupal gurus Angie Byron &amp; James Walker, the crowd was eager to hear what&#39;s in store for Drupal 8.</p>
<p>Myplanet was proud to be a platinum sponsor of the event. In addition to contributing to the organizing committe, we were onsite promoting our new Drupal Academy program. Addditionally, we were thrilled to have a number of team members who presented at DrupalCamp.</p>
<p>Here are the six sessions that were created &amp; delivered by Myplaneteers. Click on the titles to access the slides from each. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MyplanetDigital/coding-for-config-install-profile-development-using-features" target="_blank">Coding for Config: Install Profile Development Using Features: Erin Marchak</a></p>
<p>In this technical session, we&#39;ll walk through the basic steps of creating an install profile that captures a site&#39;s configuration entirely in code. Install profiles are an amazing tool for any developer, as they allow you to quickly deploy your website across environments or even packaged as a distribution profile.</p>
<p>Through this process I&#39;ll be answering the following questions about install profiles:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are they?</li>
<li>Why the heck would you ever build one?</li>
<li>What are the most common mistakes that novice profile builders typically make?</li>
<li>Should I put <strong><strong>_</strong></strong> in features or in a custom module?</li>
<li>My feature won&#39;t revert! Why?</li>
<li>How do I sell this to a client?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MyplanetDigital/101-exciting-tips-to-get-the-site-you-need-while-saving-time-and-money-and-get-that-promotion-you-deserve-in-the-process" target="_blank">101 Exciting Tips To Get The Site You Need While Saving Time And Money (And Get That Promotion You Deserve In The Process): Andre Molnar</a></p>
<p>You&#39;ve spearheaded the initiative for a new site. You&#39;ve got a vision! You&#39;ve got buy in! You&#39;ve got budget! You may even have a vendor. Awesome!  Now what?</p>
<p>This talk is as much wisdom as I can pack into an hour to ensure you get the site you need (notice I didn&#39;t say want).</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ll sprinkle in tips on how to save money.</li>
<li>I&#39;ll add a dash of time saving.</li>
<li>I&#39;ll also provide lubricant to reduce the friction between you and your vendor.</li>
<li>At the end of this, you&#39;ll know everything you need to make all the tough decisions during your project.</li>
</ul>
<p>This talk isn&#39;t <strong>just</strong> for people running projects, but for teams that have to deliver them. If you&#39;ve ever had a crazy client that just didn&#39;t seem to &#39;get it&#39; this talk may be for you.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve ever had a project from hell, this talk might help you stay out of the fire next time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MyplanetDigital/drupal-camp-2012-rest" target="_blank">Drupal As A RESTful Backend For Client Side Applications: Arvin Singla</a></p>
<p>Building client side applications almost always requires a RESTful backend to push and pull data. Drupal with the Services suite of modules allows you to convert your existing Drupal site into a REST API exposing your data and users to the world as you see fit. This opens up a wide world of possibilities including integration with client side applications and mobile applications.</p>
<p>This session will cover the basics of setting up and exposing services in Drupal 7. We will also wire up these services to a simple BackboneJS application to demonstrate reading and writing data to and from the site.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to REST and Drupal Services</li>
<li>Use cases for exposing a RESTful API</li>
<li>Demonstration of setting up simple services</li>
<li>Demonstration of integrating services with a BackboneJS application</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MyplanetDigital/selling-drupal-to-the-enterprise" target="_blank">Selling Drupal to the Enterprise: Dustin Walper</a></p>
<p>We understand the benefits of Drupal, but how do you convey its value to decision makers? Why should they choose it over a more out-of-the-box solution?  This talk will address a number concerns expressed in initial conversations with clients, and will provide a series of best practices for championing Drupal in the enterprise.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MyplanetDigital/drupal-camp-2012-sms" target="_blank">Drupal With SMS And Telephony For Fun And Profit: Arvin Singla</a></p>
<p>Ever wanted your site to literally communicate with people through other mediums? Utilizing Twilio, a cloud provider of SMS and VoIP telephony services we can make our Drupal sites do fun and interesting things.</p>
<p>In this session I hope to address the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use case examples of SMS and telephony integration</li>
<li>The state of the SMS and telephony in Drupal 7</li>
<li>Working examples of SMS and Voice integration with Drupal and Twilio</li>
<li>How to quickliy integrate SMS into your existing Drupal site (Live setup)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MyplanetDigital/open-advocacy-citizens-connected-goes-open-source" target="_blank">Open Advocacy - Citizens Connected Goes Open Source: Sebastian Lesch</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.citizensconnected.com/" target="_blank">Citizens Connected</a> is a tool that was created 2 years ago to assist organizations in online advocacy. The <a href="http://www.davidsuzuki.org/" target="_blank">David Suzuki Foundation</a> has used this tool to create dozens of campaigns and send thousands of targeted emails throughout the years.</p>
<p>Citizens Connected was originally written in Drupal 6, but has since been re-written in Drupal 7. The new D7 version takes advantage of entities, fields, and other D7 goodies, but the potential of the project is too large to continue to be maintained by the small group of existing developers. There is already a solid use case for this module and existing momentum, but there is huge potential to take it even further. We&#39;re happy to announce that we will be making this tool open source and want your help.
The tool uses ctools so developers can create &quot;look up&quot; plugins so supporters of a campaign can easily find their specific representative and send a message to them. </p>
<p>Currently we&#39;ve been integrating with <a href="http://represent.opennorth.ca/" target="_blank">Open North</a> for this functionality, and they&#39;ve done a great job of making this data easily accessible. Data integration plugins have been written into the system to integrate it with Mail Chimp, Emma, and SalesForce, although those plugins need to be further abstracted. The tool also has a few small bugs and features that need to be built out. But, Citizens Connected is well on its way to being a campaign tool that&#39;s fully integrated with Drupal.</p>
<p>After two jam-packed days at DrupalCamp, Myplanted hosted a full-day Drupal <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/259353" target="_blank">Accessibility Sprint</a>. We had a great turnout &amp; made great headway towards making Drupal 8 the most accessible version of Drupal to date. </p>
<p>Thanks to all the Myplaneteers who presented, attended &amp; supported the event. And a big thanks to DUG-TO, The Drupal Association and the DrupalCamp Committee for making it happen! See you next year.</p>
