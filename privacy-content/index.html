			<h2 id="external-privacy-policy">External Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>At Myplanet Internet Solutions Ltd., and each other member of the Myplanet group of companies (collectively, &quot;Myplanet&quot;), we are committed to maintaining the accuracy, confidentiality and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the personal information that Myplanet collects from or about you, how we use, and to whom we disclose that information.</p>
<p>Myplanet has adopted two different Privacy Policies. This particular Privacy Policy applies to how we collect, use and disclose the personal information of our customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we may interact. We have developed other documents that describe our privacy policies and practices with respect to our employees (i.e. our &quot;Employee Privacy Policy&quot;). If you are unsure of which Privacy Policy applies to you, please contact our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@myplanet.io">privacy@myplanet.io</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="privacy-policy-effective-for-canada">Privacy Policy Effective for Canada</h2>
<p>It is Myplanet&#39;s policy to comply with the privacy legislation within each jurisdiction in which we operate. Sometimes the privacy legislation and/or an individual&#39;s right to privacy are different from one jurisdiction to another. This Privacy Policy covers only those activities that are subject to the provisions of Canada&#39;s federal and provincial privacy laws, as applicable.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy has a limited scope and application.  Consequently, the rights and obligations contained in this Privacy Policy may not be available to all individuals or in all jurisdictions.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-personal-information-">What Is Personal Information?</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information is any information about an identifiable individual, other than an individual&#39;s business contact information when collected, used or disclosed for the purposes of enabling the individual to be contacted in relation to their business responsibilities.</p>
<h2 id="what-personal-information-do-we-collect-">What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>Myplanet&#39;s operations include activities related to the optimization of a userâ€™s digital experience, for example, by: designing enhanced user interfaces; conceptualizing usable and intuitive interaction systems; and integrating efficient back-end technologies. As such, Myplanet may collect personal information from individuals participating in, associated with, and/or impacted by those activities.</p>
<p><strong>Such information includes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contact and identification information, such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address;</li>
<li>Your biography, current/past personal projects, education,  work experience, blog posts and such publicly discussed information available online;</li>
<li>Product and service related information concerning the products and services that we provide to, or receive from, you; and</li>
<li>Business relationship information, including information related to your agreements, preferences, advisors and decision-makers, feed-back and information requested by or provided to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also collect market-related information, which may include personal information, concerning market trends and activities impacting our business. This information may include contract terms, financial information and other information for the purpose of market analysis and strategic planning. We may also collect information related to our media, investor and public relations activities and information related to our interactions with financial and other analysts and advisors.</p>

<p>As a general rule, Myplanet collects personal information directly from you and from public information that you share about yourself.  In most circumstances where the personal information that we collect about you is held by a third party, except where the information is public information that you share about yourself, we will obtain your permission before we seek out this information from such sources (such permission may be given directly by you, or implied from your actions).</p>
<p>From time to time, we may utilize the services of third parties and may also receive personal information collected by those third parties in the course of the performance of their services for us or otherwise. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such third parties have represented to us that they have the right to disclose your personal information to us.</p>

<li>To enable us to comply with applicable law or regulatory process; and</li>
<li>Any other reasonable purpose to which you consent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-we-use-and-disclose-your-personal-information-">How Do We Use and Disclose Your Personal Information?</h2>
<p><strong>We may use or disclose your personal information:</strong></p>

<li>For any additional purposes for which we have obtained your consent to the use or disclosure of your personal information.</li>

<p>We may share your personal information with our employees, contractors, consultants and other parties who require such information to assist us with managing our relationship with you, including third parties that provide services to us or on our behalf.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.salesforce.com" target="_blank">Salesforce.com</a> may provide certain information technology and data processing services to us from time to time so that we may operate our business, and as result, your personal information may be collected, used, processed, stored or disclosed in the United States of America and Canada.</p>
<p>In addition, personal information may be disclosed or transferred to another party during the course of, or completion of, a change in ownership of or the grant of a security interest in, all or a part of Myplanet or its affiliates through, for example, an asset or share sale, or some other form of business combination, merger or joint venture, provided that such party is bound by appropriate agreements or obligations and required to use or disclose your personal information in a manner consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Privacy Policy, unless you consent otherwise.</p>

<li>Where the personal information is publicly available; and with your consent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-consent-is-important-to-us">Your Consent is Important to Us</h2>
<p>It is important to us that we collect, use or disclose your personal information where we have your consent to do so. Depending on the sensitivity of the personal information, your consent may be implied, deemed (using an opt-out mechanism) or express. Express consent can be given orally, electronically or in writing.  Implied consent is consent that can reasonably be inferred from your action or inaction. For example, when you enter into an agreement with us, we will assume your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information for purposes related to the performance of that agreement and for any other purposes identified to you at the relevant time.</p>
<p>Typically, we will seek your consent at the time that we collect your personal information. In certain circumstances, your consent may be obtained after collection but prior to our use or disclosure of your personal information.  If we plan to use or disclose your personal information for a purpose not previously identified (either in this Privacy Policy or separately), we will endeavor to advise you of that purpose before such use or disclosure.
We may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are permitted or required to do so by applicable law or regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>You may change or withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual obligations and reasonable notice, by contacting our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@myplanet.io">privacy@myplanet.io</a> using the contact information set out below.  All communications with respect to such withdrawal or variation of consent should be in writing and addressed to our Privacy Officer.</p>
<p>We assume that, unless you advise us otherwise, you have consented to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as explained in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-your-personal-information-protected-">How is Your Personal Information Protected?</h2>
<p>Myplanet will endeavor to maintain physical, technical and procedural safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information in question.  These safeguards are designed to prevent your personal information from loss and unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or destruction.</p>

<h2 id="updating-your-personal-information">Updating Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>It is important that the information contained in our records is both accurate and current.  If your personal information happens to change during the course of our relationship, please keep us informed of such changes.</p>

In addition, the personal information may have been destroyed, erased or made anonymous in accordance with our record retention obligations and practices.  In the event that we cannot provide you with access to your personal information, we will endeavor to inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.</p>
